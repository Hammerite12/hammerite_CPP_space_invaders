# ðŸš€ Space Invaders C++ Game
This is my first C++ project developed with the Raylib library using the principles learned form the ITSchool C++ course. The purpose of this project is to provide a fun way to practice C++ programming and familiarize myself with game development concepts.

## ðŸ’» Getting Started with Visual Studio
1. Download and unzip the source code files.
2. Open the Space Invaders project folder in Visual Studio.
3. Make sure you have the raylib library installed on your system.
